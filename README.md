# Algorithms Learning Repository

This repo is my personal space for studying, implementing, and practicing algorithms in multiple languages (currently Java, C, and Python).

## Goals
- Strengthen problem-solving and data structure skills
- Practice clean, well-documented code
- Build a reference I can revisit anytime

## Structure
- `basics/` – Foundational problems (arrays, strings, lists)
- `sorting/` – Sorting algorithms (Bubble, Quick, Merge…)
- `searching/` – Linear, Binary, etc.
- `advanced/` – Graph algorithms, Dynamic Programming, etc.

Each folder contains:
- Source files
- A brief `README.md` describing the algorithm, time/space complexity, and example input/output.

## How to Run

```bash

# Java
javac sorting/QuickSort.java && java sorting.QuickSort

# C
gcc basics/arrays/find_max.c -o find_max && ./find_max
